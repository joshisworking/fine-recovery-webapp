# Simulated Fine Recovery Project (Work in Progress)

## Overview

This project is a work in progress, aiming to create a Simulated Fine Recovery System for managing court fines and payments. It simulates the process of tracking and recovering fines for different subjects (individuals or entities) within various courthouses.

**Note**: The frontend part of the application has not yet been completed.

## Technologies Used

- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Frontend: React with TypeScript

## Database Setup

This project includes a `database` folder that contains the necessary files for setting up the database:

- `create_tables.sql`: This file contains SQL queries to create the required tables for the fine recovery system.
- `add_sample_data.sql`: For testing purposes, the `add_sample_data.sql` file provides sample data to populate the database with initial records.

**Note**: The names and details used in the `add_sample_data.sql` file were generated programmatically and are fictional. They do not represent real individuals or entities.
